# Arduino Nano PCB Design using KiCad
KiCad is an open-source software suite for creating electronic circuit schematics, printed circuit boards (PCBs), and associated part descriptions. KiCad supports an integrated design workflow in which a schematic and corresponding PCB are designed together, as well as standalone workflows for special uses. KiCad also includes several utilities to help with circuit and PCB design, including a PCB calculator for determining electrical properties of circuit structures, a Gerber viewer for inspecting manufacturing files, a 3D viewer for visualizing the finished PCB, and an integrated SPICE simulator for inspecting circuit behavior.
KiCad runs on all major operating systems and a wide range of computer hardware. It supports PCBs with up to 32 copper layers and is suitable for creating designs of all complexities. KiCad is developed by a volunteer team of software and electrical engineers around the world with a mission of creating free and open-source electronics design software suitable for professional designers.
